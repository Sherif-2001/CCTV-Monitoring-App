# CCTV Monitoring App

Welcome to the Flutter CCTV Monitoring App with built-in machine learning capabilities. This application is designed to connect to a CCTV system and process the video feed using machine learning algorithms to detect instances of fighting or violence.

## Features

- **Real-time CCTV Monitoring:**
  - Connect to your CCTV system and view the live video feed directly from your mobile device.

- **Machine Learning for Violence Detection:**
  - Utilizes advanced machine learning models to analyze video frames for signs of fighting or violence.

- **Alert System:**
  - Automatically triggers alerts when potential violence is detected, providing timely notifications to security personnel.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:**
  - Cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.

- **TensorFlow Lite:**
  - Lightweight version of TensorFlow for on-device machine learning.

- **CCTV Integration:**
  - Connects to CCTV systems using standard protocols for seamless video streaming.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
